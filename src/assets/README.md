### **Quick Launch Support**

- **Run it from Steam in DX12 first to ensure the RPC works correctly.**
- Supports **log refresh detection** to ensure accurate data after launching.

### **Error Handling & Logging**  
- Comprehensive exception handling with error popups.  
- Saves error logs automatically for troubleshooting.
